# diffusion models

Though this is a certain type of latent model, it is different enough from alternative approaches, like VAEs,
that I separate it out.


## Notes

implement unet. i guess that's the parameterized epsilon function.

then we need to do the scaling and noise to the ground truth.
and then just train it? it's pretty simple, no?
