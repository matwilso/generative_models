For more details about the implementation, I plan to add more here/maybe a post.

TODO: add summaries of the files and their purposes.

For reference, see the original unixpickle and google research implementations that I based this off of:
- https://github.com/openai/improved-diffusion
- https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/diffusion_distillation

Extensions that may me worthwhile to try to learn more:
- get this implementation working on cifar10, adding bad extra tricks (mostly better arch)
