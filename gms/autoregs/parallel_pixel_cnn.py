# i probably ought to do this one as well.
# it seems useful to be able to sample autoreg models more quickly

# maybe we also want to try creating our own mixture of hybrid RNN + autoreg.

# like try on mnist but a new idea. but to show it's actually doing anything, we may need to make it a bit harder.
